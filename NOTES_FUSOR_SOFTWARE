INTRODUCTION
===============================================

This software is comprised of 2 programs:
- get_data:  reads analog data and transmits the data to the display program via internet connection
- display:   receives the data values from the get_data program, 
             reads image from webcam,
             displays the webcam image, analog values, and graph of analog values
             records the data to file so it can be reviewed later

These 2 programs could be run on the same computer, using the loopback network interface;
however it is best to run them on seperate computers for the following reasons:
- Ground Loops - When the Raspberry Pi, that has the ADC converters attached, is powered
  by an AC supply then an AC ripple is seen on the ADC data. To avoid this I power this
  Raspberry PI by a rechargeable battery, and don't connect a display.
- The High Speed ADC converter being used to analyze the pulses from the HE3 Proportional
  Counter does not work well when the Webcam is attached to the same Raspberry PI.

    RPI-Data and RPI-Display:  Raspberry PI 3. The get_data program is run on RPI-Data; and
        the display program is run on RPI-Display.

    ADC-1: Dataq Instruments DI-149. Specs: 10 kHz max sample rate, differential inputs.

    ADC-2: Measurement Computing USB-204.  Specs 500 kHz max sample rate. SE Analog inputs.
        This needs to be high sample rate because the pulses from the scaler are only
        about 2 us wide.

    voltage, current:  sensor outputs from HV power supply 
        (** NOT THE ACTUAL HIGH VOLTAGE FROM THE SUPPLY **)

    pressure:  analog output voltage from Kurt J Lesker 275i Pirani Gauge

    battery:  USB Battery Pack for Raspberry Pi - 10000mAh - 2 x 5V outputs
        https://www.adafruit.com/product/1566

    scaler:  Ludlum 2929 Dual channel scaler.  This scaler has an Amp Out BNC connector, which
        is connected to ADC-2 through Resistor R.

The get_data program acquires data from the 2 ADC devices, analyzes the data and
formats a data_t (see common.h). Once the display program establishes a connection
to the get_data program, then the data_t is sent to the display program once per
second. Note that the data_t has placeholders for the webcam jpeg buff, but the
jpeg buff is filled in by the display program when it receives the data_t.

The display program receives the ADC data from the get_data program in a data_t
structure, once per second. The display program adds the webcam image to the data_t,
and writes the data to a file so that it can be reviewed later. While the data is
being received (LIVE mode) the display program will also display the data in real time
as it is received. 

===============================================
RUNNING THE SOFTWARE
===============================================

Ther get_data program should start automatically when the battery power is applied to the 
RPI-Data, assuming that the suggested change to /etc/rc.local has been made.

The display program is typically executed without command line options. In this case the display program
will establish conection with the get_data program, and receive and display the data. 

The display program's runtime controls include:
  Shift-Esc              : Quit
  ?                      : Help
  Ctrl-p, or Alt-p       : Capture Screenshot
  Left, Right, Home, End : Summary Graph Time Select (*)
  '-', '+'               : Summary Graph Time Scale
  's', '1', '2'          : Select ADC Graph, and Modify Y Scale
  'a', 'd', 'w', 'x'     : Camera Pan 
  'z', 'Z'               : Camera Zoom
  'r'                    : Camera Pan/Zoom Reset 
  '3', '4'               : Change Neutron Pulse Height Threshold
  '5', '6'               : Change Neutron CPM Summary Graph Scale

  (*) Use Ctl or Alt with Left/Right Arrow to increase response

The display program's command line options include:
  -h                           : help
  -v                           : display version
  -g <width>x<height>          : default = 1920x1000
  -s <live-mode-data-server>   : default = rpi_data 
  -p <playback-mode-file-name> : select playback mode
  -x                           : don't capture cam data in live mode
  -t <secs>                    : generate test data file

The display program's display includes:
- camera image
- voltage, current, pressure, neutron cpm, and neutron pulse height threshold values
- SUMMARY graph, displays a graph of the voltage, current, pressure, and nuetron cpm values
- ADC Data Graph: this graph displays 1 second of ADC data, and can be configured to display
  either: (1) neutron pulse ADC data, (2) voltage ADC data, (3) current ADC data, or 
  (4) pressure ADC data.

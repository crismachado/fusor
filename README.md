# OVERVIEW

This program provides data acquisition for a Fusor.

From Wikipedia: 
> A Fusor is a device that uses an electric field to heat ions to 
> conditions suitable for nuclear fusion. The machine has a voltage 
> between two metal cages inside a vacuum. Positive ions fall down 
> this voltage drop, building up speed. If they collide in the center, 
> they can fuse. This is a type of inertial electrostatic confinement device.

# OVERVIEW

This program provides data acquisition for a Fusor.

From Wikipedia: 
> A Fusor is a device that uses an electric field to heat ions to 
> conditions suitable for nuclear fusion. The machine has a voltage 
> between two metal cages inside a vacuum. Positive ions fall down 
> this voltage drop, building up speed. If they collide in the center, 
> they can fuse. This is a type of inertial electrostatic confinement device.

Refer to screenshots/screenshot1.png for data collected from a fusor.

Refer to program usage documentation in NOTES_FUSOR_SOFTWARE.

This program is designed for use with the United States Keyboard. The UK keyboard should also work. Other keyboard layouts should work but the keyboard controls may differ from the documentation.
